Remove all the invalid menu items in one click. 

== Description ==
This is a very simple plugin to remove invalid navigation menu items in one click. When we move pages to the trash but they still display in the menu. This is so boring deleting all the invalid menu items one by one and time consuming too. 

So, I have created this plugin so that WordPress users can easily remove the invalid menu items. Just install and activate the plugin then go to the menu you want to edit. You will find a button beside Save menu to remove the items. This is extremely helpful when you install theme demo content and remove the demo pages. 

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/remove-invalid-menu-items` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Navigate to Appearance > Menus to use the plugin
