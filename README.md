## About The Project

This is a very simple plugin to remove invalid navigation menu items in one click. When we move pages to the trash but they still display in the menu. This is so boring deleting all the invalid menu items one by one and time consuming too.

So, I have created this plugin so that WordPress users can easily remove the invalid menu items. Just install and activate the plugin then go to the menu you want to edit. You will find a button beside Save menu to remove the items. This is extremely helpful when you install theme demo content and remove the demo pages.

### Installation

Unzip remove-invalid-menu-items.zip
Upload the contents of remove-invalid-menu-items.zip to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

All you have to do is install and activate the plugin then go to the navigation menu page. In the menu edit page, you will find a button called ‘Delete invalid menu items’ beside the Save menu button. Just click on the button and all the invalid menu items will be removed.
